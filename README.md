# Analysis-Coal_Oil_production_vs_CO2_emmission
# Investigate a dataset  This project analyzes the CO_2 emissions  and compare it with Coal and Oil consumption. The datasets are taken from [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/data/).  * 
**CO_2 emission:** The dataset contains yearly per capita CO_2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels (metric tonnes of CO_2 per person). * **Coal consumption:**  This dataset contains yearly per capita coal consumption in tonnes. * **Oil consumption:** This dataset contains yearly per capita oil consumption in tonnes per year per person.
